## only for joking
this file is an automated file for windows and only make a loop with many orders in the same time                                   
that makes the RAM crash and it's very hard to make this file stop unless you stoped the device                                        and restarted it again 

### The commands inside the batch file is start to start new cmd window and start website with                                         the Browser.
